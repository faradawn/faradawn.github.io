                  <h1>Education</h1>
                  <p>
                    I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science and Math from the <a href="https://cs.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" style="color: #f70000;">University of Chicago</a>. I had the privilege to have <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~haryadi/" target="_blank" style="color: #f70000;">Professor Haryadi Gunawi</a> as my advisor. My research focuses on Cloud Storage, Distributed Systems, and Machine Learning for Systems.

                <!-- My research -->
                <h1>Academic Research</h1>

                <h3>1. "Achieving Predictable Latency in SSD Storage Clusters." [2023]</h3>
                <p>To solve the unstable latency problem in cloud environments, we designed a light-weight neural network to estimate the completion time of an I/O request for each solid-state drive (SSD), which achieved 80-97% accuracy with less than 10 nanosecond overhead, bring stable latency across storage clusters. The paper is under submission to OSDI 2024.</p>

                <h3>2. "Optimizing Cache Performance for Multi-Process Servers." [2023]</h3>
                <p>Traditional cache prefetchers work well in sequential access workloads, but modern multi-process applications exhibit non-sequential access. Thus, we developed a machine learning approach to 1) identify an access stream and 2) then apply a classical algorithm on it. The hybrid method outperformed both pure ML method and traditional techniques, achieving near 90% hit rate on Microsoft Research Cambridge traces. </p>

                <h3>3. "Scalability Study of Seagate’s Distributed System." [2022] </h3>
                <p>To study how scalable Seagate's cloud storage, CORTX, was, I designed 7 workloads to determine the correlation between the throughput (read/write speed) and size of the cluster. By finding the optimal master-to-worker ratio, network pool, etc., I successfully produced a linear-scaling result that proved the scalability of their system. The results were accepted by the company. </p>
